They use sunlight as energy to combine water and carbon dioxide, creating glucose (plant food) and releasing oxygen as a bonus!\n\n**The Simple Equation:**\nSunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide â†’ Glucose (food) + Oxygen\n\nThis is why plants are so important - they literally turn sunlight into food and give us oxygen to breathe!
